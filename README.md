# Sorting-Algorithms
I implemented two search algorithms, Bubble sort and Quick sort using classes. In order to implement the two algorithms I used virtual methods in the main “sorting” class so that in the inherited classes the overloaded functions will be virtual too. The function  “sort_it” is written in accordance with the particularities of both bubble and quick sort. In the end I used two classes, “BubbleSorT” and “QuickSortT” in order to execute the sorting algorithms and make the necessary statics 	using the methods from the “Stat” class. In the main functions the sorting algorithms preform a worst case scenario sorting and print to the screen the statistics of both algorithms.
